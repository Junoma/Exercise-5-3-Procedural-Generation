# Exercise 5.3â€”Procedural Generation

Exercise for MSCH-C220

An implementation of a procedurally-generated 3D maze. Also, a simple in-game menu. There is also some animations, character movements and enemy controls, as well as preperation for a multiplayer mode.

## Implementation

Built using Godot 4.1.1

## References

Lots of code, an updated version of the maze runner where I got the enemy sprite and the character sprite.

## Future Development

If I had more time I would add an AI for the enemy, I couldn't figure out how to get the enemy to spawn in the same way as the player, because of the randomly generated maze structure. I made animations for the player character but I also didn't get the opportunity to implement them. I experienced a lot of godot crashes, over 20 during my work time, so maybe looking into another way to implement my code changes as well.
